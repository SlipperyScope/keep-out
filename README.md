# Ludum 47

Oh boy oh boy, here we go again. This time we're using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and the [Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template).

## Start Here

1. Install [node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Optionally install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) in case we need to all be on the same node version.
3. Make sure you have [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed.
4. Clone this repo. Please note that the main branch is `main` instead of `master`.
5. Run `npm install` to download the dependencies.
6. Run `npm start` to start the Webpack server which will automatically open the game in a new tab

## Contributing

1. Make sure to commit changes to a new branch
2. When you are ready to merge those changes, push the branch (`git push -u origin branch-name`)
3. Open a new PR with your changes. The push message in your CLI should generate the URL for you
4. Alternatively, use the [gh cli tool](https://cli.github.com/).
5. Don't merge code until someone code reviews it. Or at least gives it a Game Jam green seal of approval.
6. Pull requests will generate previews using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so we can see each other's builds.
7. Merging pull requests will rebuild the main branch so we'll always have the latest build ready.

And most importantly, have fun and don't merge broken code ðŸ¥³
